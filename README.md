# Public-API-Request
Have fun getting some data from the [random user API](https://randomuser.me/api/). It was the 5th project from the Team Treehouse Full-Stack Course

## General Info

The aim for this is displaying a couple techniques, namely retrieving data from an API, while dynamically adding it to the DOM and utilizing 
this newly added html to toggle between elements and filtering search results.

I altered the CSS a bit to give it a more polished look. 

The changes are the hover animations on the card, font and color scheme.

## Technologies

* HTML 5   
* CSS 3
* JavaScript ES6 

The app is started by downloading all the files and running the html from that folder. 
### Note:

Future update may include more data from the API, additional page pagination.
